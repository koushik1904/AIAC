The == operator is used for comparison (checking for equality), while a single = is used for assignment. print(\"Equal\"): This line is indented, meaning it is part of the if statement's block. It will only be executed if the condition a == 10 is true. In this case, since a is 10, the condition is true, and the string \"Equal\" is printed to the output. So, the corrected code simply assigns a value to a variable and then checks if that variable's value is 10, printing \"Equal\"\n"
